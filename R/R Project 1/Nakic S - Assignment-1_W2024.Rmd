## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(3,5\ldots,29)$.

```{r}
seq(3, 30, 2)
seq(3, 29, 2)
```

## Question 1 (32 points)

## Q1a (8 points)
Create and print a vector `x` with all odd numbers from 5 to 120 and a vector `y` containing multiples of 5 in the same range. 

HINT: use seq() function. Calculate the sum of lengths of the vectors `x` and `y`.

HINT: use length()

```{r}
## Creating vector x using seq() to capture all odd numbers from 5 to 120

x <- seq(5, 120, by = 2)

## Creating vector y using (seq) to capture all multiples of five from 5 to 120
y <- seq(5, 120, by = 5)

## Creating vector sum_of_lengths to denote the sum of the length of vectors x and y
sum_of_lengths <- length(x) + length(y)

## Printing vectors x and y
print(x)

print(y)

## Printing the sum of the lengths of x and y
print(sum_of_lengths)

## Checking work by printing the length of the vectors x and y
length(x)

length(y)


## We know that 58 + 24 = 82, so we know that our sum_of_lengths vector is giving us the desired output.
```

## Q1b (8 points)
Create a new vector, `y_cube`, with the cube of elements at indices 2, 4, 6, 10, 15, 18, 21, and 25 from the variable `y`. 

HINT: Use indexing rather than a `for` loop. Calculate the mean and median of the LAST five values from `y_cube`.
```{r}
## Sampling vector y
y <- 1:25

## Extracting elements at specified indices and calculate their cubes
y_cube <- y[c(2, 4, 6, 10, 15, 18, 21, 25)] ^ 3

## Calculating mean and median of the last five values in y_cube
last_five_mean <- mean(tail(y_cube, 5))
last_five_median <- median(tail(y_cube, 5))

## Printing mean and median
print(last_five_mean)
print(last_five_median)


```

## Q1c (8 points)
For a given factor variable `factorVar <- factor(c("2.5", "7.1", "6.3", "4.8"))`, would it be correct to use the following commands to convert factor to number?

`as.numeric(factorVar)`

If not, explain your answer and provide the correct one.

```{r}
## No, the as.numeric() function will not provide the wanted outcome when applied directly to a factor variable.  What it will return is the integer representation of the factor levels, not the numeric values that the levels represent.

## Given factor variable
factorVar <- factor(c("2.5", "7.1", "6.3", "4.8"))

## Converting factor to character and then to numeric
numericVar <- as.numeric(as.character(factorVar))

## Printing the result
print(numericVar)


```

## Q1d (8 points)
A comma-separated values file `dataset.csv` consists of missing values represented by Not A Number (`null`) and question mark (`?`). How can you read this type of files in R? 

**NOTE**: Please make sure you have saved the `dataset.csv` file at your current working directory.

Print the head of the file to ensure everything is correct.

```{r}
## Reading the dataset in the .csv file and read the missing values 
dataset <- read.csv("dataset.csv", na.strings = c("null", "?"))

## Printing the head of the dataset 
head(dataset)
```

# Question 2 (32 points)

## Q2a (8 points)
Compute: $$\sum_{n=4}^{25}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$$

HINT: Use `factorial(n)` to compute $n!$.

```{r}
## Inserting the function to calculate factorial
factorial <- function(n) {if (n == 0) {return(1)} else {return(n * factorial(n - 1))}}

##Computing the sum
sum_value <- 0
for (n in 4:25) {
  sum_value <- sum_value + (-1)^(n + 1) / factorial(2 * n + 1)
}
## Printing the head of the dataset 
print(sum_value)

```

## Q2b (8 points)
Compute: $$\prod_{n=2}^{6} \left(3n + \frac{2}{3^n} \right)$$
NOTE: The symbol $\Pi$ represents multiplication.
```{r}
## Defining the set of the initial value of the product
product_value <- 1

## Computing the product
for (n in 2:6) {product_value <- product_value * (3 * n + 2 / 3^n)}

## Printing the head of the dataset
print(product_value)

```

### Q2a and Q2b Guidance
For Q2a and Q2b, you'll need to apply basic mathematical concepts in R. Don't worry if we haven't covered a similar exact problem in class. If you understand how to code in R and the basic math operations (like factorial, powers, sums, and products), you're all set!

Example for Understanding:
Let's start with a simpler example:
Compute the sum of the first 5 square numbers. In mathematical terms, this is:


$$\sum_{n=1}^{5}{(n)^{2}}$$
 

which translates to $1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2+5^2$.

In R, you could solve this by:
```{r}
numbers <- 1:5          # Create a vector of numbers 1 to 5
squared_numbers <- numbers^2  # Square each element of the vector
sum_squares <- sum(squared_numbers)  # Sum up the squared numbers
sum_squares
```

Now, come back to Q2a and Q2b. Your task in those questions is similar. You'll use loops to iterate over a range of numbers, applying the specified mathematical operations at each step. Remember to use built-in R functions like `factorial()`, `sum()`, and `prod()` when needed.

In **Q2a**, you'll be computing a sum, but each term involves a factorial and a power. Remember, R can perform these operations on entire vectors.

In **Q2b**, you'll be computing a product, and each term is a simple arithmetic expression involving numbers and powers.


## Q2c (8 points)
Describe what the following R command does:
`rep(1:3, each = 2)[NA]`
```{r}
## 1:3 creates a vector that contains the integers 1,2,3.

##rep(1:3, each = 2) repeats each element of the vector 1:3 twice resulting in a longer vector
rep(1:3, each = 2)

## "NA" subsets the resulting vector with a missing value (NA). In R, this operation returns NA
rep(1:3, each = 2)[NA]

## Therefore the result of the command is "NA"


```

## Q2d (8 points)
Describe the purpose of `is.logical()`, `is.character()`, `is.numeric()`, and `is.na()` functions? Please use `x <- c("a", FALSE, "b", NA, 2, TRUE)` to explain your description.
```{r}
## It is used to check the data type or properties of elements in a vector or variable.

## is.logical(): This is a function that checks if the elements in a vector are of logical data type (TRUE or FALSE). This means that applying the above formula will return TRUE for the third and sixth elements because they are logical values (FALSE and TRUE), and FALSE for the other elements.

## is.character(): This function checks if the elements in a vector are of character data type. This means that applying the above formula will return TRUE for the first, third, and fourth elements because they are character strings ("a", "b", and "NA" is treated as a missing character value), and FALSE for the other elements.

## is.numeric(): This function checks if the elements in a vector are of numeric data type (integers or floating-point numbers). This means that applying the above formula will return TRUE for the fifth element because it is a numeric value (2), and FALSE for the other elements.

## is.na(): This function checks if the elements in a vector are missing values (NA).Lastly the above formula will return TRUE for the fourth element because it is "NA" which means missing, and FALSE for the other elements. Note that NA is not a missing value in terms of logical, character, or numeric types, it's a distinct type on its own, but is.na() checks for the presence.


```

# Question 3 (36 points)
The `airquality` dataset contains daily air quality measurements in New York from May to September 1973. The variables include Ozone level, Solar radiation, wind speed, temperature in Fahrenheit, month, and day. Please see the detailed description using `help("airquality")`.

Install the `airquality` data set on your computer using the command `install.packages("datasets")`. Then load the `datasets` package into your session.
```{r}
##Creating dataset
install.packages("dataset", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/")
library(dataset)

```

## Q3a (4 points)
Display the last 10 rows of the `airquality` data set.
```{r}
## Loading the airquality dataset
data(airquality)

## Displaying the last 10 rows of the dataset
tail(airquality, 10)


```

## Q3b (8 points)
Compute the median of the first four variables (Ozone, Solar.R, Wind and Temp) for the fifth month using the `sapply()` function.

HINT: You might need to consider removing the `NA` values; otherwise, the median will not be computed. 
```{r}

## Loading the airquality dataset
data(airquality)

## Viewing the structure of the dataset
str(airquality)

## Checking the column names
names(airquality)

## Subsetting the data for the fifth month (May)
may_data <- airquality[airquality$Month == 5, ]

## Removing NA values
may_data <- na.omit(may_data)

## Computing the median for each variable
median_values <- sapply(may_data[, c("Ozone", "Solar.R", "Wind", "Temp")], median)

## Printing the median values
print(median_values)



```

## Q3c (8 points)
Construct two boxplots for the `Ozone ` and `Solar.R` variables.
Then, compute the values of all outliers which lie beyond the whiskers.
```{r}
## Loading the dataset
data(airquality)

## Constructing boxplots for Ozone and Solar.R variables
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(airquality$Ozone, main="Ozone", ylab="Ozone (ppb)", ylim=c(0, 200))
boxplot(airquality$Solar.R, main="Solar.R", ylab="Solar Radiation (lang)", ylim=c(0, 400))

## Computing outliers for Ozone
ozone <- airquality$Ozone
ozone_outliers <- boxplot.stats(ozone)$out

## Computing outliers for Solar.R
solar <- airquality$Solar.R
solar_outliers <- boxplot.stats(solar)$out

## Printing the outliers
cat("Outliers for Ozone: ", ozone_outliers, "\n")
cat("Outliers for Solar.R: ", solar_outliers, "\n")



```

## Q3d (8 points)
Compute the lower quartile of the `Temp` variable with two different methods.

HINT: Only show the lower quartile using indexing.
For the type of quartile, please see https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/quantile.
```{r}
## Loading the airquality dataset
data(airquality)

## Computing the lower quartile of Temp using quantile function
lower_quartile_quantile <- quantile(airquality$Temp, probs = 0.25)

## Printing the lower quartile
print(lower_quartile_quantile)


```

## Q3e (8 points)
Construct a bar chart to describe the number of entries by `Month`.

HINT: use the `table()` function to count and tabulate the number of entries within a `Month`.

Don't forget to name each axis and have a title for the plot.

```{r}
## Loading the dataset
data(airquality)

## Creating a bar chart of entries by month
barplot(table(airquality$Month),
        main = "Entries by Month",
        xlab = "Month",
        ylab = "Number of Entries",)


```
