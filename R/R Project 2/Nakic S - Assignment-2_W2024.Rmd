## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(100,97\ldots,4)$.

```{r}
seq(100, 3, -3)
```




## Question 1 (40 points)

The Titanic Passenger Survival Data Set provides information on the fate of passengers on the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner "Titanic." The dataset is available from the Department of Biostatistics at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine (https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.csv) in several formats. Store the Titanic Data Set `titanicDataset` using the following commands. 


```{r}
##install.packages("titanic")
library(titanic)
titanicDataset <- read.csv(file = "https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
str(titanicDataset)

## Installing and load the 'titanic' package if you haven't already
install.packages("titanic")
library(titanic)

## Reading the Titanic dataset from the provided URL
titanicDataset <- read.csv(file = "https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

## Printing the structure of the Titanic dataset
str(titanicDataset)

```

a) Extract and show the columns `name`, `fare`, `sibsp`, and `parch` into a new data frame named 'titanicSubset'. (5 points)
```{r}
## Extracting the specified columns into a new dataframe 'titanicSubset'
titanicSubset <- titanicDataset[, c("name", "fare", "sibsp", "parch")]

## Viewing the first few rows of the 'titanicSubset' dataframe
head(titanicSubset)


```
b) Numerical data: Use the count() function from the `dplyr` package to calculate the total number of passengers who were children (age less than 18) and survived. (5 points)
HINT: To count the occurrences of survived or not in the titanicDataset data frame using the `dplyr` package, you can use the pipe operator (%>%) to chain operations. 

```{r}
## Loading the dplyr package
library(dplyr)

## Filtering the Titanic dataset to include only passengers who were children (age less than 18) and survived
child_survivors <- titanicDataset %>%
  filter(age < 18 & survived == 1) %>%  
  ## Filter for passengers who were children (age less than 18) and survived
  count()

## Viewing the results
print(child_survivors)


```



c) Categorical data: Use count() and group_by() functions from the dplyr package to calculate the number of passengers by `sex`. (5 points)
HINT: Use group_by() first then pipe the result to count() to calculate the number of passengers. 
```{r}
## Loading the dplyr package
library(dplyr)

## Assuming you have a dataframe named 'titanicDataset' with a column named 'sex'

## Using group_by() to group the data by 'sex', then pipe it to count() to calculate the number of passengers
passenger_counts <- titanicDataset %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  count()

## Viewing the result
print(passenger_counts)


```

d) Find the passengers in the data frame whose age information is missing, and fill them with the median age of passengers. (3 points)

```{r}
# Calculate the median age of passengers
median_age <- median(titanicDataset$age, na.rm = TRUE)

# Replace missing age values with the median age
titanicDataset$age[is.na(titanicDataset$age)] <- median_age

# Check if there are any missing age values left
missing_age_count <- sum(is.na(titanicDataset$age))

# Print the count of missing age values
print(paste("Number of missing age values after filling with median age:", missing_age_count))


```

e) Use the aggregate() function to calculate the 'survivalCount' of each `pclass` and calculate the survival rate of passengers in each passenger class. Then, draw a conclusion on which passenger class has the highest survival rate. (5 points)


```{r}
## Calculating survival count of each pclass
survival_counts <- aggregate(survived ~ pclass, data = titanicDataset, FUN = sum)

## Calculating total count of passengers in each pclass
total_counts <- aggregate(survived ~ pclass, data = titanicDataset, FUN = length)

## Merging survival counts and total counts by pclass
survival_summary <- merge(survival_counts, total_counts, by = "pclass")

## Renaming columns for clarity
colnames(survival_summary) <- c("pclass", "survivalCount", "totalCount")

## Calculating survival rate
survival_summary$survivalRate <- survival_summary$survivalCount / survival_summary$totalCount * 100

## Printing the survival summary
print(survival_summary)

## As seen in the data the First class has a higher survival rate

```


f) Use a boxplot to display the distribution of `fare` for each `sex` and infer which gender tends to pay higher fares. (5 points)
```{r}

## Selecting a mirror interactively
chooseCRANmirror(ind=1) 

## Installing the packages needed
install.packages("ggplot2")

# Loading necessary packages
library(ggplot2)

## Creating a boxplot
ggplot(titanicDataset, aes(x = sex, y = fare, fill = sex)) +(ylim(0,500)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Sex", y = "Fare", title = "Distribution of Fare by Sex") +
  theme_minimal()

## As seen in the data it is evident that females pay a higher fare

```


g) Calculate the mean `fare` for each `sex` and describe if the calculation aligns with the boxplot. (5 points)
```{r}
## Calculating the mean fare for each sex
fare_means <- aggregate(titanicDataset$fare, by = list(titanicDataset$sex), FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)

## Printing the mean fare for each sex
print(fare_means)

## The calculation aligns with the boxplot as it is evident that the female fars tend to be between roughly 130 - 270 and male fares are more concentrated towards the 50-100 fare range. 

```


h) Use the for loop and if control statements to list the women's non-empty home destinations, age 50 or older, who embarked from Southampton on the Titanic. (7 points)
```{r}
## Creating an empty vector to store the results
selected_passengers <- c()

## Looping through each row in the Titanic dataset
for (i in 1:nrow(titanicDataset)) {
  ## Checking if the passenger is a woman, has a non-empty home destination, is age 50 or older, and embarked from Southampton
  if (titanicDataset$sex[i] == "female" && !is.na(titanicDataset$home.dest[i]) && 
      titanicDataset$age[i] >= 50 && titanicDataset$embarked[i] == "S") {
    ## If all conditions are met, add the passenger to the selected_passengers vector
    selected_passengers <- c(selected_passengers, paste(titanicDataset$name[i], "-", titanicDataset$home.dest[i]))
  }
}

## Printing the selected passengers
print(selected_passengers)

```



## Question 2 (15 points)

100 computers work together in a network. Based on historical data, each computer has a probability of 0.03 of encountering a software issue. If a computer encounters an issue, it affect the network's performance.

```

b) Utilize the Binomial approximation to estimate the probability that at least 5 computers out of 100 encounter software issues. (5 points)
```{r}

## Mean and standard deviation of the Binomial distribution
mu <- n * p
sigma <- sqrt(n * p * (1 - p))

## Standardizing k
z <- (k - mu) / sigma

## Calculating cumulative probability (at least 5 successes)
prob_at_least_5 <- pnorm(z)

## Printing the result
cat("Probability of at least 5 computers encountering software issues:", prob_at_least_5, "\n")


```

c) Assume the first and second computers are independent. Calculate the conditional probability that the second computer (Computer B) encounters a software issue given that the first computer (Computer A) does not encounter any issue. (5 points)
```{r}
## Parameters for question
p <- 0.03  # probability of encountering an issue for a single computer

## Probability that Computer A does not encounter any issues
prob_no_issue_A <- 1 - p

## Probability that Computer B encounters an issue (given A doesn't encounter any issue)
prob_issue_B_given_no_issue_A <- p

## Conditional probability that Computer B encounters an issue given that Computer A doesn't encounter any issue
conditional_probability <- prob_issue_B_given_no_issue_A

## Printing the results
cat("Conditional probability that the second computer encounters a software issue given that the first computer does not encounter any issue:", conditional_probability, "\n")

```

## Printing the probability
cat("Probability of receiving 4 or more emails in a day:", prob_4_or_more, "\n")


```
