## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(2,4,6,\ldots,20)$.

```{r}
## Using seq() to create the vector
vector <- seq(from = 2, to = 20, by = 2)

## Printing the vector
print(vector)


```
## Question 1 [15 Pts]

a) [5 Pts] Midterm and final grades of some students are given as c(87, 72, 80, 91, 85, 96, 40, 34, 61) and c(59, 68, 52, 62, 78, 70, 35, 28, 45). Set R variables `midterm` and `final` respectively. Then find the least-squares line relating the final to the midterm. 

   Does the assumption of a linear relationship appear to be reasonable in this case? Give reasons to your answer as a comment.
```{r}
## Set midterm and final grades
midterm <- c(87, 72, 80, 91, 85, 96, 40, 34, 61)
final <- c(59, 68, 52, 62, 78, 70, 35, 28, 45)

## Fit a linear regression model
model <- lm(final ~ midterm)

## Print the summary of the model
summary(model)

## Plot midterm vs. final grades
plot(midterm, final, main = "Scatterplot of Midterm vs. Final Grades", 
     xlab = "Midterm Grades", ylab = "Final Grades", pch = 16)

## Add the least-squares line
abline(model, col = "red")

## Plot the residuals
residuals <- resid(model)
plot(midterm, residuals, main = "Residuals vs. Midterm Grades", 
     xlab = "Midterm Grades", ylab = "Residuals", pch = 16)
abline(h = 0, col = "blue")

##The assumption of a linear relationship between midterm and final grades may not be entirely reasonable in this case.This assumes that the relationship between the two variables is linear, meaning that for every unit increase in the midterm grade, the final grade increases by a constant amount IE a slope.

```

b) [5 Pts] Plot the final as a function of the midterm using a scatterplot and graph the least-square line in red color on the same plot. 
```{r}
## Given midterm and final grades
midterm <- c(87, 72, 80, 91, 85, 96, 40, 34, 61)
final <- c(59, 68, 52, 62, 78, 70, 35, 28, 45)

## Fitting a linear model
model <- lm(final ~ midterm)

## Printing the summary of the model
summary(model)

## Plotting the data
plot(midterm, final, main = "Scatterplot of Midterm vs Final Grades",
     xlab = "Midterm Grades", ylab = "Final Grades")

## Adding the least-squares line
abline(model, col = "red")

## Adding a legend
legend("bottomright", legend = "Least-Squares Line", col = "red", lty = 1)


```

c) [5 Pts] Use the regression line to predict the final grades when the midterm grades are 83 and 22. 
```{r}
## Given midterm grades
midterm_new <- c(83, 22)

## Predicting the final grades using the regression line
final_predicted <- predict(model, newdata = data.frame(midterm = midterm_new))

## Printing the predicted final grades
print(final_predicted)


```



## Question 2 [45 Pts]

This question makes use of package "plm". Please load Crime dataset as follows:
```{r load_packages}
#install.packages("plm")
library(plm) 
data(Crime)
```

a) [5 Pts] Display the first 7 rows of 'crime' data and display the names of all the variables, the number of variables, then display a descriptive summary of each variable. 
```{r}
## Displaying the first 7 rows of the 'crime' dataset
head(Crime, 7)

## Displaying the names of all the variables and the number of variables
cat("Variable names:", "\n")
print(names(Crime))
cat("Number of variables:", length(names(Crime)), "\n")

## Displaying a descriptive summary of each variable
summary(Crime)


```

b) [5 Pts] Calculate the mean,variance and standard deviation of probability of conviction (prbconv) by omitting the missing values, if any. 
```{r}
## Calculating the mean of prbconv
mean_prbconv <- mean(Crime$prbconv, na.rm = TRUE)

## Calculating the variance of prbconv
var_prbconv <- var(Crime$prbconv, na.rm = TRUE)

## Calculating standard deviation of prbconv
sd_prbconv <- sd(Crime$prbconv, na.rm = TRUE)

## Printing the results
cat("Mean of prbconv:", mean_prbconv, "\n")
cat("Variance of prbconv:", var_prbconv, "\n")
cat("Standard deviation of prbconv:", sd_prbconv, "\n")


```
c) [5 Pts] Use `lpolpc` (log-police per capita) and `smsa` variables to build a linear regression model to predict probability of conviction (prbconv).  And, compare with another linear regression model that uses `polpc` (police per capita) and `smsa`.

   [5 Pts] How can you draw a conclusion from the results? 
   (Note: Full marks requires comment on the predictors)
```{r}
## Model 1: Using lpolpc and smsa
model1 <- lm(prbconv ~ lpolpc + smsa, data = Crime)

## Model 2: Using polpc and smsa
model2 <- lm(prbconv ~ polpc + smsa, data = Crime)

## Comparing the models
summary(model1)
summary(model2)

## The coefficient of lpolpc (the natural log of polpc) is statistically significant (p-value < 0.001), indicating a significant positive relationship between the natural log of police per capita and the probability of conviction.The coefficient of polpc (police per capita) is statistically significant (p-value < 0.001), indicating a significant positive relationship between police per capita and the probability of conviction.Therefore, both models suggest that there is a positive relationship between police presence and the probability of conviction.

```

d) [5 Pts] Based on the output of your model, predict the output for different factors of `smsa` when `polpc` is set to 0.0025. Use both the predict function and intercept and slope equations and compare the results. 
```{r}
## Given value of polpc
polpc_value <- 0.0025

## Creating a data frame with smsa values
new_data <- data.frame(smsa = unique(Crime$smsa))

## Adding polpc_value to the new_data
new_data$polpc <- polpc_value

## Predicting using model 2 (polpc and smsa)
predicted_output_model2 <- predict(model2, newdata = new_data)

## Printing predicted output using predict function
print(predicted_output_model2)

## Calculating predicted output using intercept and slope equation
intercept <- coef(model2)[1]
slope_polpc <- coef(model2)[2]
slope_smsa <- coef(model2)[3]

predicted_output_equation <- intercept + slope_polpc * polpc_value + slope_smsa * new_data$smsa

## Printing predicted output using equation
print(predicted_output_equation)




```
e) [5 Pts] Find Pearson correlation between probability of prison sentence `prbpris` and tax per capita `taxpc`; and also Pearson correlation between probability of conviction `prbconv` and probability of arrest `prbarr`. 

   [5 Pts] What conclusions can you draw? Write your reasons as comments.
```{r}
## Loading the plm package
library(plm)

## Loading the Crime dataset
data(Crime)

## Calculating Pearson correlation between prbpris and taxpc
corr_prbpris_taxpc <- cor(Crime$prbpris, Crime$taxpc)

## Calculating Pearson correlation between prbconv and prbarr
corr_prbconv_prbarr <- cor(Crime$prbconv, Crime$prbarr)

## Printing the results
print(paste("Pearson correlation between prbpris and taxpc:", corr_prbpris_taxpc))
print(paste("Pearson correlation between prbconv and prbarr:", corr_prbconv_prbarr))


## Pearson Correlation between prison sentence and tax per capita is negative so therefore a higher probability of arrest is associated with a lower probability of conviction.

##Pearson correlation between probability of conviction and probability of arrest is positive so therefore a higher probability of arrest is associated with a higher probability of conviction.
```

f) [5 Pts] Display the correlation matrix of the variables: prbconv, prbpris, density, polpc. 

   [5 Pts] Write what conclusion you can draw, as comments. 
   
```{r}
## Loading the plm package
library(plm)

## Loading the Crime dataset
data(Crime)

## Selecting the variables of interest
selected_vars <- c("prbconv", "prbpris", "density", "polpc")

## Subsetting the dataset to include only selected variables
subset_data <- Crime[, selected_vars]

## Calculating the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix <- cor(subset_data)

## Printing the correlation matrix
print(correlation_matrix)

## There is a  positive correlation between the probability of conviction and the ratio of police per capita . The correlation coefficient is roughly 0.450.
```




## Question 3 [15 Pts]

This question makes use of package "ISwR". Please load `airquality` dataset as following:

```{r}
# or install.packages("ISwR")
library(ISwR) 
data(airquality)
str(airquality)
```


a) [5 Pts] Plot a histogram to assess the normality of the `Ozone` variable, then explain why it does not appear normally distributed. 
```{r}
## Loading the ISwR package
library(ISwR)

## Loading the airquality dataset
data(airquality)

## Plotting a histogram of the Ozone variable
hist(airquality$Ozone, main = "Histogram of Ozone", xlab = "Ozone", col = "red", border = "black")

```

b) [5 Pts] Create a boxplot that shows the distribution of `Ozone` in each month. Use different colors for each month. 

```{r}
## Loading the ISwR package
library(ISwR)

## Loading the airquality dataset
data(airquality)

## Setting different colors for each month
month_colors <- c("red", "blue", "green", "orange", "purple")

## Creating a boxplot of Ozone by month
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality, col = month_colors,
        main = "Distribution of Ozone by Month",
        xlab = "Month", ylab = "Ozone")


```

c) [5 Pts] Create a matrix of scatterplots of all the numeric variables in the `airquality` dataset (i.e. Ozone, Solar.R, Wind and Temp.)
(Hint: investigate pairs() function) 

```{r}
## Loading the ISwR package
library(ISwR)

## Loading the airquality dataset
data(airquality)

## Selecting the numeric variables
numeric_vars <- c("Ozone", "Solar.R", "Wind", "Temp")

## Creating a matrix of scatterplots
pairs(airquality[numeric_vars], main = "Scatterplot Matrix of Numeric Variables")


```



## Question 4 [25 Pts]

Many times in data analysis, we need a method that relies on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems. In fact,  this is a mathematical technique, which is used to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event and is called the *Monte Carlo Method*. 

Consider that We roll a die 10 times and we want to know the probability of getting more than 3 times of even numbers. This is a problem for the Binomial distribution, but suppose we don't know anything about Binomial distribution. We can easily solve this problem with a Monte Carlo Simulation.   


a) [5 Pts] The Monte Carlo Method uses random numbers to simulate some process. Here the process is rolling a die 20 times. Assume the die is fair. What is the probability of success or getting an even number in rolling the die once?
```{r}
## Defining the total number of possible outcomes
total_outcomes <- 6

## Defining the number of even numbers
even_numbers <- 3

## Calculating the probability of getting an even number
probability_even <- even_numbers / total_outcomes

## Printing the result
print(paste("Probability of getting an even number when rolling the die once:", probability_even))


```


b) [10 Pts] Define a function named `one.trial`, that simulates a single round of rolling a die 20 times and returns true if the number of even numbers is > 5.
```{r}
## Defining the function one.trial
one.trial <- function() {
  ## Simulating rolling a die 20 times
  rolls <- sample(1:6, 20, replace = TRUE)
  
  ## Counting the number of even numbers
  even_count <- sum(rolls %% 2 == 0)
  
  ## Returning TRUE if the number of even numbers is > 5, otherwise return FALSE
  return(even_count > 5)
}

## Testing the function
result <- one.trial()
print(result)

```

c) [5 pts] Repeat the function `one.trial` for `N = 100,000` times and sum up the outcomes and store the result in a variable named `desired.output`. Compute the probability of getting more than 5 times of even numbers by using relative frequency. 

```{r}
## Defining the function one.trial
one.trial <- function() {
  ## Simulating rolling a die 20 times
  rolls <- sample(1:6, 20, replace = TRUE)
  
  ## Counting the number of even numbers
  even_count <- sum(rolls %% 2 == 0)
  
  ## Returning TRUE if the number of even numbers is > 5, otherwise return FALSE
  return(even_count > 5)
}

## Setting the number of trials
N <- 100000

## Initializing variable to store the number of desired outcomes
desired.output <- 0

## Performing N trials
for (i in 1:N) {
  ## Running one trial
  outcome <- one.trial()
  
  ## Updating the count of desired outcomes
  desired.output <- desired.output + outcome
}

## Computing the probability of getting more than 5 times of even numbers using relative frequency
probability <- desired.output / N

## Printing the result
print(paste("Probability of getting more than 5 times of even numbers:", probability))


```

d) [5 pts] Use the Binomial formula you learned before to calculate such probability and Compare it with the probability value obtained in part (c).

```{r}
## Defining the parameters
n <- 20 # Number of trials
p <- 1/2 # Probability of success in a single trial
k <- 5 # Number of successes we're interested in

## Calculating the probability using the binomial formula
binomial_probability <- 1 - pbinom(k, size = n, prob = p)

## Printing the result
print(paste("Probability of getting more than 5 times of even numbers using the binomial formula:", binomial_probability))


```

Congratulations! you have completed the first run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

If there is further interest, put all the above logic in a function, and call it 50 times at least, and store the results in a vector called Prob then take the mean of Prob vector to be more accurate.
